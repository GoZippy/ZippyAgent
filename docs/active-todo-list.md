- **CRITICAL:** 6 tasks (Foundation, Core Packages)
- **HIGH:** 2 tasks (Applications, Infrastructure)
- **MEDIUM:** 1 task (Documentation, CI/CD)

---

## üí° **RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Start with external repo integration** - this provides immediate value and reference implementations
2. **Focus on Supervisor service** - this is the core orchestration engine
3. **Build dashboard incrementally** - start with basic cluster view, add features gradually
4. **Use containerization from the start** - ensures consistent deployment across environments
5. **Document as you build** - maintain architecture docs alongside development
